# Map-Generator
Originally started in Javascript when I very first started teaching myself coding so, although I've streamlined and fixed solid portions of it, there's still a handful of redundancy/inefficiency issues and things to be cleaned up in the newer Java version. Meant to serve as the setting foundation for future evolution simulation project using neural networks. Very much an extended work in progress project to keep coming back to in order to figure out new coding concepts.

-CONTROLS-
Controls are simply pressing the letters you can see in parentheses in the user interface with the exception of 9 which refreshes with a new map. Can also click buttons on the right.
You can click on the map to figure out which cell you're in and what biome it is.
Couple of map manipulating functions bound to keys 1-8 for debugging/testing.
