# Map-Generator
Originally started when I very first started teaching myself coding so, although I've streamlined and fixed solid chunks of it, there's still quite a few redundancy issues and things to be cleaned up.
Meant to serve as the setting foundation for future evolution simulation project using neural networks.

-CONTROLS-
Controls are simply pressing the letters you can see in parantheses in the user interface with the exception of 9 which refreshes with a new map. 'b' will display biome percentages in system output.
You can click on the map to figure out which cell you're in and what biome it is.
Couple of map manipulating functions bound to keys 1-7 for debugging/testing.
